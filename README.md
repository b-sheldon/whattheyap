- describe the environment you set up.
I created a web development environment with a lot of different features! It allows me to run webpages locally (npm run dev) and hot-reload them without reloading the page. It also uses more modern styling (sass) and autoprefixes these styles to make them compatible with more browsers. It also makes sure everything is backwards-compatible (babel). It also reviews the code as I write it, highlighting and fixing errors in code standard (eslint).

- any questions about what/why/how that you feel are unresolved?
I'm still a little confused on how this new environment will change my workflow with creating websites, and which tools are the best/which ones I should use. I'm sure that as I create more webapps, I will learn this flow!
